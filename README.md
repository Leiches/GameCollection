Purpose of the Application:
This collection of games serves as a unified platform that combines several games into a single application. 
Each game was developed by one of the group members and we have also included the Sudoku from the lecture.

User Guide for the Game CineLine (by Moritz Alker):
CineLine is about guessing the release year of well-known films. 
A game consists of 10 rounds or films. And for each film, the user has to guess the year on the timeline. 
To do this, the user must hover over the timeline with the cursor and click on the timeline to select a year. 
The difference to the correct year of release is then deducted from the score, which starts at 1000.

User Guide for the Game Crazy Chicken (by Benedikt Scholz):
This recreation of the classic "Crazy Chicken" is an endless game. The game loop is rather simple, the player 
needs to shoot the objects on the screen while avoiding the red ones. The development of the game also included
custom-types for a linked-list as arrays were not smooth enough when it came to deleting components as well as a 
highscore and leaderboard system which sadly relied on the backend and is therefore not included in the hosted site
as we did not have a server for the backend.

User Guide for the Game Crossword (by Daniel Leichinger):
Crossword puzzle is a classic game. To play just click on a cell and type a Letter. If everything is correct, the
background color of the cell will become light green. When hosted localy with the node server the Game is a Daily Crossword puzzle, 
because the Words get picked on the node server and there is a function that always picks the same words for a day.

Local Run Guide:
1. Choose the main branch and load the latests version
2. Access the server folder and run it using "node index.js"
3. Access the client folder and run it using "npm run dev"
4. Press the link that appears in the console
5. SUCCESS!
