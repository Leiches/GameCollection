Live Application:

Purpose of the Application:
This collection of games serves as a unified platform that combines several games into a single application. 
Each game was developed by one of the group members and we have also included the Sudoku from the lecture.

User Guide for the Game CineLine (by Moritz Alker):
CineLine is about guessing the release year of well-known films. 
A game consists of 10 rounds or films. And for each film, the user has to guess the year on the timeline. 
To do this, the user must hover over the timeline with the cursor and click on the timeline to select a year. 
The difference to the correct year of release is then deducted from the score, which starts at 1000.
